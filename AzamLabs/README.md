# Azam Basha

Azam Basha is a self-hosted network emulation platform for building and running
virtual labs (routers, switches, firewalls, servers, and more) in your browser.

This repository is a landing page for **Azam Basha** downloads, deployment scripts,
and upgrade instructions.

## Downloads

| Artifact | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Network Install Script | Hands-off installer for a fresh Ubuntu 26.04 (27H1 "Resolute") host — pulls and installs the latest release over the network. | [download](https://codeberg.org/api/packages/netkillui/generic/pnetlab-core-assets/0.channel/pnetlab-network-install-latest.sh) |
| OVA (autoinstaller) | Minimal Ubuntu 26.04 image with an unattended autoinstaller — boots and installs Azam Basha itself. | [download](https://mega.nz/file/uNAz3JDb#CQA93KkaU3XrCs6EIosChOjYonn1W4ELgnLm7NcZ2Wg) |
| Desktop Install Bundle | Installs on Ubuntu Desktop workstation environment on bare metal. Tested on Ubuntu 26.04 Desktop and Xubuntu 26.04 Desktop — Xubuntu is recommended for its lighter resource footprint. Dual boot alongside Windows or external SSD setup works. | [download](https://mega.nz/file/rRZzXSRa#fsAL-CGdLPf0gCjBVoeIeMuo-A1Fsdm3nCx2Ea3u_a4) |

## Requirements

- 64-bit host, hardware virtualization support (Intel VT-x / AMD-V)
- Minimum 4 vCPU / 8 GB RAM / 40 GB disk for light use; scale up for larger labs
- Ubuntu 26.04 LTS ("27H1 Resolute") for the network install method

## Installation Options

### Option 1 — Single-Line Installation via Uploaded Folder / Zip
If you uploaded and extracted the package directory on your Ubuntu 26 server:

```bash
cd /opt/azambasha && sudo bash install.sh
```

---

### Option 2 — Single-Line Installation via GitHub Directly (Recommended)
On a fresh or existing Ubuntu 26.04 server, run this single line in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git && sudo rm -rf /tmp/AZAM-BASHA /opt/azambasha && sudo git clone https://github.com/azambasha1987/AZAM-BASHA.git /tmp/AZAM-BASHA && (sudo cp -r /tmp/AZAM-BASHA/EMULATOR/Azam-Pnet /opt/azambasha 2>/dev/null || sudo cp -r /tmp/AZAM-BASHA/EMULATOR/Azam-Basha /opt/azambasha 2>/dev/null || sudo cp -r /tmp/AZAM-BASHA /opt/azambasha) && cd /opt/azambasha && sudo bash install.sh
```

*(If you already have `/opt/azambasha`, you can run `cd /opt/azambasha && sudo bash install.sh`)*

---

### Option 3 — Cluster Satellite (Worker Node) Installation
To provision a dedicated headless worker VM to scale out compute capacity for your Master Azam Basha server:

```bash
cd /opt/azambasha && sudo bash install-satellite.sh
```

Join the worker to your master server:
```bash
sudo azam-satellite-join --master <MASTER_IP> --id 1 --name "Satellite-1" --psk <GENERATED_PSK>
```

---

### Web Dashboard & Login (Master Node):
* **URL**: `https://<YOUR_UBUNTU_IP>/`
* **Username**: `admin`
* **Password**: `azam`
* **Console**: `Native` *(or HTML5)*

## Updating

Azam Basha v8 includes built-in version freezing and offline update isolation to guarantee absolute stability.

```bash
sudo azambasha-menu
```

### Manual upgrade (if needed)

1. Back up `/opt/unetlab` (or your configured lab data path) and any custom node images using `sudo azambasha-backup`.
2. Apply offline update packages:
  
  ```bash
  sudo dpkg -i debian/pool/resolute/main/pnetlab_*.deb
  sudo apt-get -f install
  ```
  
3. Reboot and verify the web UI and running labs come back up correctly.
