## 2. Common Operational Tasks

### Running System Health Diagnostics
```bash
bash scripts/azambasha-health-check.sh
```
*Displays CPU KVM virtualization status, RAM & KSM savings, storage usage, web services status, and an inventory of installed QEMU/IOL/Docker images.*

### Creating an Immediate Backup
```bash
sudo bash scripts/azambasha-backup-restore.sh backup
```
*Generates a timestamped `.tar.gz` archive in `/opt/unetlab/data/Backups/` containing MySQL database dumps, lab files, user accounts, and templates.*

### Restoring from Backup
```bash
sudo bash scripts/azambasha-backup-restore.sh restore /opt/unetlab/data/Backups/azambasha_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz
```

### Fixing Node Startup Failures & Stale Locks
When lab nodes fail to boot or stay stuck in stopped state:
```bash
sudo bash scripts/azambasha-fix-permissions.sh
```
